Debugging:

Debugging, in computer programming and engineering, is a multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem, and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it. The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works.

Tasks	Code description

main.h	Header file

0-main.c	Tests that function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

2-largest_number.c	Fixed the program so it prints the largest integer.
