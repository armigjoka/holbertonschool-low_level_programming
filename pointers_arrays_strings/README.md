Pointers, arrays and strings:

Pointers

A pointer * is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int ) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.


Arrays

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store are a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.


Strings

Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.


Simplifying the code:
